#                                                         Language Detection Web App using Flask and Machine Learning


## üìå 1. Introduction

Language detection is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) which involves determining the language in which a given piece of text is written. This project demonstrates a language detection system built using Python, machine learning (Naive Bayes), and Flask for deployment through a web interface. The primary objective is to allow users to input any sentence or phrase and receive an instant prediction of its language.

---

## üéØ 2. Objectives

Build a machine learning model to detect language from a sentence.

Design a clean and interactive web interface using Flask and HTML/CSS.

Allow real-time predictions via user input.

Deploy the system locally for demonstration purposes.

## üìÅ 3. Dataset

- Source: A custom CSV file (language.csv) is used.
- Features:
   Text: Input sentence or phrase.
   Language: Target output (language label).
- Sample Data:
   mathematica
   Copy
   Edit
   Text,Language
   Bonjour, French
   Hello, English
   Hola, Spanish
  
## üß† 4. Machine Learning Model

- 4.1 Data Preprocessing
   Convert textual data into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.
   Split dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

- 4.2 Model Selection
   Model Used: Multinomial Naive Bayes
   Reason: Performs well on text classification tasks involving word frequency counts.

- 4.3 Model Training
   cv = CountVectorizer()
   X = cv.fit_transform(x)
   x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
   model = MultinomialNB()
   model.fit(x_train, y_train)
  
## 4.4 Model Accuracy
    Evaluated using .score() method.
    Accuracy typically exceeds 95% depending on dataset size and diversity.

## üåê 5. Web Application (Flask)

- 5.1 Overview
   A Flask-based web application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the language detection system.

- 5.2 Features
   Text input field for user sentence.
   "Detect Language" button to submit input.
    Real-time prediction display.

- 5.3 Flask Backend (app.py)
   Handles:
   Model loading and prediction logic.
   Routes for rendering HTML templates and processing form data.

- 5.4 HTML Template (index.html)
   Provides:
   Simple and clean UI using HTML and styled with CSS.
  Responsive layout for better user experience.

5.5 CSS Styling (style.css)
Implements:
Modern layout with card-based design.
Styled form, buttons, and result box for better readability.
